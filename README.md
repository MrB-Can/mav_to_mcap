# MAV / TLOG to MCAP Converter
Converting MAV / TLOG to MCAP file format to see data in Foxglove.
## What is TLOG?
The ***TLOG*** format, also known as the Telemetry Log format, is a binary file format commonly used in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) coloquially known as drones. TLOG files are often generated by flight control software or ground control stations to record telemetry data during UAV flights. This telemetry data typically includes information about the vehicle's position, attitude, sensor readings, and other flight-related parameters.

1. Binary Format: TLOG files are stored in a binary format, which means they are not human-readable. This format is efficient for storing large volumes of telemetry data quickly and accurately.

2. Header: TLOG files usually start with a header section that contains metadata about the log file. This metadata may include information such as the file format version, the vehicle's name or identifier, the date and time of the log creation, and more.

3. Messages: The bulk of the TLOG file consists of telemetry messages. Each message typically represents a single data point recorded at a specific time during the UAV's flight. These messages are structured in a binary format and have a specific layout. The exact structure of each message can vary depending on the flight control software or system generating the TLOG file.

4. Message Types: TLOG files can contain various types of telemetry messages, each representing different aspects of the UAV's flight. Common message types include GPS position data, attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) data, sensor readings (e.g., IMU, barometer), battery information, motor or servo outputs, and more.

5. Timestamps: Each telemetry message typically includes a timestamp indicating when the data was recorded. Timestamps are crucial for reconstructing the chronological order of events during the flight.

6. Checksums: To ensure data integrity, TLOG files may include checksums or error-checking codes for each telemetry message. These codes help detect and correct errors that may have occurred during recording or transmission.

7. Compression (Optional): In some cases, TLOG files may use compression to reduce storage space. Popular compression algorithms like zlib may be applied to telemetry data before writing it to the log file. This compression is typically lossless, ensuring that no data is lost during storage.

8. Indexing (Optional): For large TLOG files, an indexing mechanism may be included to facilitate faster data retrieval. This index helps locate specific telemetry messages within the file quickly.

9. Footer (Optional): Some TLOG formats include a footer section that summarizes key information about the log file. This can include statistics, total message count, and other relevant metadata.

10. Software Compatibility: TLOG files are often associated with specific UAV flight control software or ground control stations. Users typically rely on compatible software tools to open, view, and analyze TLOG files.

It's important to note that TLOG formats can vary between different UAV platforms and flight control software. Therefore, the specific structure and content of a TLOG file may vary depending on the system generating it. To work with TLOG files effectively, it's essential to refer to the documentation provided by the UAV or flight control software manufacturer to understand the format used in a particular context.
## What is MAVLink?
MAVLink (Micro Air Vehicle Communication Protocol) is a lightweight communication protocol commonly used in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones, and other autonomous vehicles. It's designed to facilitate communication between onboard systems, ground control stations, and other components of these vehicles. Below, I'll describe MAVLink in detail:

1. Lightweight Protocol: MAVLink is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for use in resource-constrained environments such as small UAVs and embedded systems. It uses binary serialization, which minimizes message size and maximizes transmission speed.

2. **Message-Based:** MAVLink is a message-based protocol. Information is exchanged through discrete messages, each of which has a specific format and purpose. Messages can represent various types of data, such as telemetry data, control commands, status information, and more.

3. **Message Format:** Each MAVLink message consists of a header and a payload. The header contains essential information like the message ID, sender's system ID, and recipient's system ID. The payload contains the actual data associated with the message.

4. **Message Types:** MAVLink defines a wide range of message types, each with a unique ID and purpose. Common message types include heartbeat, system status, GPS information, attitude data (roll, pitch, yaw), sensor readings (e.g., IMU, barometer), mission commands, and more. The message type ID ensures that the receiver understands the content of the message.

5. **Decentralized:** MAVLink is a decentralized protocol, meaning that it doesn't rely on a centralized server or infrastructure for communication. Instead, it allows multiple components (e.g., flight controllers, ground stations, companion computers) to communicate directly with one another.

6. **System and Component IDs:** In a MAVLink network, each system (e.g., a UAV or ground control station) is assigned a unique system ID. Additionally, each system can have multiple components, each identified by a unique component ID. These IDs are crucial for routing messages to the correct destination.

7. **Compatibility:** MAVLink is widely adopted and supported by various UAV hardware and software vendors. This compatibility allows different components from different manufacturers to communicate seamlessly, promoting interoperability in the UAV ecosystem.

8. **Telemetry:** One of the primary uses of MAVLink is for telemetry data exchange. UAVs send telemetry data, including sensor readings, GPS coordinates, battery status, and vehicle attitude, to ground control stations for monitoring and analysis.

9. **Command and Control:** MAVLink also supports command and control messages, allowing ground control stations or other components to send instructions to the UAV. These commands can include waypoints for autonomous flight, changes in flight modes, or other control directives.

10. **Open Source:** MAVLink is an open-source protocol, and its source code is freely available. This openness encourages the development of MAVLink-compatible software and fosters a collaborative community of UAV enthusiasts and developers.

11. **Extensions:** MAVLink supports extension mechanisms, allowing developers to define custom message types for specialized applications or additional data types not covered by standard MAVLink messages.

12. **Security:** While MAVLink itself does not provide built-in security features, it's essential to implement security measures, such as encryption and authentication, when using MAVLink in systems where data privacy and security are critical.

MAVLink has become a de facto standard in the UAV industry due to its simplicity, efficiency, and wide adoption. It plays a crucial role in enabling communication and data exchange in autonomous vehicles, helping them operate safely and effectively.
## What is MCAP?
The MCAP file format is a standardized container format for storing heterogeneous robotics data1. It was introduced by Foxglove to streamline and standardize data recording in the robotics stack1.

Here are some key features of the MCAP file format:

1. Heterogeneous Data Storage: MCAP can store message data encoded in a variety of serialization formats. This means it can embed multiple heterogeneous data streams, with corresponding metadata, into a single file.

2. High-Performance Writing: MCAP is optimized for high-performance writing as it leverages an append-only structure1. This allows data to be streamed to disk or over the network without seeking backwards1.

3. Crash-Proof Data Recording: The append-only structure also makes it possible to recover partially-written files, even if on-device recording was interrupted by a software crash or power loss1.

4. Self-Contained Files: MCAP files are completely self-contained. Message schemas are embedded in the file, and no additional dependencies are required for decoding1. They also support the ability to embed attachments containing calibration information, core dumps, or any other application-specific data1.

5. Integration with Robotics Tooling: The MCAP file format is designed to integrate easily with other robotics tooling2.

This format is primarily intended for use in robotics applications and works well under various workloads, resource constraints, and durability requirements.
